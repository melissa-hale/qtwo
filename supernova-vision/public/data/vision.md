# What We're Building

SMART is evolving from a Q2-built personalization tool into an **open platform** where partners contribute intelligence and build native experiences, while FIs leverage their existing marketing tools.

## The Shift

For 20 years, Q2 has built custom integrations for everything. We've reached a critical point: **we cannot sustain this model indefinitely.** The future is different—we're enabling partners to extend our capabilities rather than building everything ourselves.

## Why This Matters

**Operational Reality:** Technical debt from millions of lines of custom integration code slows our velocity and strains engineering teams.

**Strategic Alignment:** Platform approach is already a company-wide priority. SMART leads this transformation as the intelligence layer.

**Revenue Impact:** Protects $9.5M SMART ARR, expands to 100% customer adoption, unlocks new revenue streams through trait packs and connector subscriptions.

## The Vision

Make personalization effortless by opening SMART as the intelligence layer that connects partners, FIs, and their users.
