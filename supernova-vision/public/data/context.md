# Strategic Context

## Where Q2 Is Going

Q2 is shifting from a **product company** to a **platform company**. Instead of building every integration ourselves, we're enabling partners to extend our capabilities and FIs to use their existing tools.

This isn't a new direction—it's a company-wide strategic priority that leadership has endorsed. The platform shift reduces our integration burden, accelerates partner innovation, and creates competitive moat through ecosystem lock-in.

## How SMART Enables It

SMART becomes the **intelligence layer**—the open, transparent data foundation that makes the platform valuable.

**For Partners:** Access to Q2 behavioral data makes their products smarter. Easy integration paths encourage building on our platform instead of standalone solutions.

**For FIs:** Partner intelligence enriches personalization. Integration with existing martech tools removes adoption barriers.

**For Q2:** Partners build and maintain their own integrations, dramatically reducing our engineering burden while protecting and expanding revenue.

The flywheel: Partners consume data → build better experiences → contribute their insights back → FIs get better outcomes → ecosystem grows → Q2 reduces burden.
